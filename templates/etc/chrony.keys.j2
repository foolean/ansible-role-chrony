# This is an example chrony keys file.  It enables authentication of NTP
# packets with symmetric keys when its location is specified by the keyfile
# directive in chrony.conf(5).  It should be readable only by root and the
# user under which chronyd is running.
#
# It can contain ID/key pairs which can be generated using the “keygen”
# option from “chronyc”.  A list of supported hash functions and output
# encoding is available by consulting the "keyfile" directive in the
# chrony.conf(5) man page.
#
# It's recommended to generate random keys using the chronyc keygen command.
#
# Example:
#   chronyc keygen 1 SHA256 256 >> /etc/chrony/chrony.keys
#
# The above would generate a 256-bit SHA-256 key using ID 1.
#
# Examples of valid keys (Don't use the example keys!):
#1 MD5 AVeryLongAndRandomPassword
#2 MD5 HEX:12114855C7931009B4049EF3EFC48A139C3F989F
#3 SHA1 HEX:B2159C05D6A219673A3B7E896B6DE07F6A440995
